++ The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, 
introduced by Barbara Liskov. 
- It states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class 
without introducing errors or unexpected behavior in the system. 
- In other words, a subclass should be substitutable for its base class 
without altering the correctness of the program.

++ Key Concepts of LSP
- Substitutability: If a program is designed to work with a base class (or interface), 
it should work correctly with any derived class (or implementation) without requiring changes or causing errors.
- Behavioral Compatibility: Subclasses must adhere to the expected behavior of the base class, 
honoring its contract (preconditions, postconditions, and invariants).
- Goal: Ensure that inheritance hierarchies are designed in a way that derived classes 
extend the base class meaningfully, maintaining the system's reliability and predictability.

In C#, LSP is critical when using inheritance or implementing interfaces to ensure 
that derived types can be used interchangeably with their base types.

++ Real-World Example
- Consider a payment processing system with a PaymentProcessor base class and derived classes like 
CreditCardProcessor and GiftCardProcessor. 
- If GiftCardProcessor violates LSP by requiring a different validation process that breaks the base class’s contract 
(e.g., requiring a PIN that credit cards don’t need), substituting GiftCardProcessor for PaymentProcessor 
could cause errors. 
- To fix this, define an IPaymentProcessor interface with a clear contract, 
and ensure all implementations adhere to it.

++ Caveats and Considerations
- Over-Splitting Abstractions: Creating too many interfaces or classes to avoid LSP violations 
can lead to overcomplicated designs.
- Design Trade-offs: Balancing LSP with other SOLID principles (like OCP) requires careful thought 
to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Testing: Subclasses should be tested to ensure they meet the base class’s contract, 
especially for critical behaviors.
